# DnD-Campaign-Manager
A simple tool providing multiple features that are helpful for DMs managing their DnD5e-Campaigns.

This tool is inspired by DnD management tools such as [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) and [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/).
The goal of is this tool is to provide simliar functionality for managing characters, spells and monsters of your DnD5e world while being lightweight and easy-to-use.

The first version of this tool is supposed to be a command line tool that allows:
- creation of your own characters, classes, races, monsters and spells through JSON files
- access to information about characters, monsters, and spells at any time (e.g. while dm-ing a session)

Ideas for future improvements include:
- management of XP and level-ups of your characters
- a user interface
- automatic creation of character sheets and other helpful character documents
- keeping track of character's resources (such as spell slots, HP, Ki, or exhaustion) while playing
