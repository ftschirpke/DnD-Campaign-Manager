On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.\n\nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:\n\n- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\n- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.\n- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\nIf you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.\nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.\n\nOnce you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.",
