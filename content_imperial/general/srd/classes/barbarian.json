It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.\n\nOnce you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the table below, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.\n\nLevel|Rages|Rage Damage\n1|2|+2\n2|2|+2\n3|3|+2\n4|3|+2\n5|3|+2\n6|4|+2\n7|4|+2\n8|4|+2\n9|4|+3\n10|4|+3\n11|4|+3\n12|5|+3\n13|5|+3\n14|5|+3\n15|5|+3\n16|5|+4\n17|6|+4\n18|6|+4\n19|6|+4\n20|Unlimited|+4",
