# TODO

Content that may not be formatted perfectly or a part of it is not implemented as functionality.

## Features that are description-only for now, but could be implemented in the future
(vaguely in order of importance)

- Ability Score Increases (ASIs) and Feats
  - Characters need to define their ASI choices and/or chosen feats
  - feats need to be defined (probably just like features)

- Special choices such as Eldritch Invocations (Warlock) and Fighting Styles ([Fighter](classes/fighter.json) and Ranger)

- how to format features that have multiple steps e.g. something at level 3, something at level 5, and another thing at level 7
  - [Infernal Legacy (Tiefling)](races/tiefling.json)
  - [Song of Rest (Bard)](classes/bard.json)

- how to format features that have choices and effects for these choices e.g. expertise
  - [Expertise (Bard)](classes/bard.json)

- [Cantrip (High Elf)](subraces/high_elf.json) - how to format the choice of a cantrip from the wizard spell list
- [Infernal Legacy (Tiefling)](races/tiefling.json) - how to format cantrips and spellcasting

- [Jack of All Trades (Bard)](classes/bard.json) - no idea how to implement this yet...

- should "Resources" (name could be changed) exist outside of the description? (examples would be ki points or bardic inspiration)

- Free decisions such as [Fighter's](classes/fighter.json) action surge - but should they even get an implementation?

- [Rage (Barbarian)](classes/barbarian.json) - could Rage be a parameter?
- [Path of the Berserker](subclasses/path_of_the_berserker.json): "Frenzy" - the bonus action attack (and the exhaustion)
- [Path of the Berserker](subclasses/path_of_the_berserker.json): "Mindless Rage" - Rage as a parameter would be needed though - probably not going to happen

## Changes that could bring more clarity

- [Path of the Berserker](subclasses/path_of_the_berserker.json): "Intimidation Presence" - splitting the action into 2 e.g. "Start Intimidation Presence" and "Extend Intimidation Presence"?
