# TODO

Content that may not be formatted perfectly or a part of it is not implemented as functionality.

## Features that are description-only for now, but could be implemented in the future

- [Cantrip (High Elf)](subraces/high_elf.json) - how to format the choice of a cantrip from the wizard spell list

- [Rage (Barbarian)](classes/barbarian.json) - could Rage be a parameter?
- [Path of the Berserker](subclasses/path_of_the_berserker.json): "Frenzy" - the bonus action attack (and the exhaustion)
- [Path of the Berserker](subclasses/path_of_the_berserker.json): "Mindless Rage" - Rage as a parameter would be needed though - probably not going to happen

## Changes that could bring more clarity

- [Path of the Berserker](subclasses/path_of_the_berserker.json): "Intimidation Presence" - splitting the action into 2 e.g. "Start Intimidation Presence" and "Extend Intimidation Presence"?
