# D&D Content

The content provided here is just an example that is supposed to give inside into the required format of the JSON files for your D&D content. Although this content is supposed to be the content from the original SRD and basic rules by WotC, I cannot guarantee that the content is correct, complete, or up-to-date.

Legally, it is impossible to publish any other content than the content from the SRD, the basic rules, or homebrew content by creators who are willing to publish it here.
