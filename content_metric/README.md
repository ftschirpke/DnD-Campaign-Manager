# Conversion from imperial to metric units

The conversions are not intended to be perfect, but rather be a reasonable, mostly accurate conversion that gives people who grew up with the metric unit system a rough feeling for how big a certain distance is or how much of a liquid a spell is talking about.

I don't guarantee the conversions to be correct or complete.

## Approximate conversion values:

- 1 foot = 0.3m = 30cm
- 1 mile = 1.6km
- 1 gallon = 4.5l
- 1 pound = 0.45kg = 450g
