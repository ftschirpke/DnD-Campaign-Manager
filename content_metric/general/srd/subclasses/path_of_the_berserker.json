On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 18m away from you.\n\nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.",
