This die changes as you gain monk levels. It changes to a d6 at level 5, a d8 at level 11, and a d10 at level 17.\n- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.\n\nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in “Equipment.”"

You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.\n\nWhen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.\n\nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\n\nKi save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\nFlurry of Blows\nImmediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.\n\nPatient Defense\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.\n\nStep of the Wind\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.",
