# Contributing

I am excited you are considering contributing to this project.

**Please contact me on GitHub or preferably [via email](mailto:tschirpf@student.hu-berlin.de).**

This is especially important because the project is still in its beginnings and only managed by myself right now. Thus, the documentation is lacking. Although I am trying my best to always document my ideas in markdown files and list all the TODOs, I understand that it might be very hard to understand anything in this project. There are probably many ideas which only exist in my head and I forgot to explain them anywhere. 

So, **do not hesitate to ask questions.**

I would be happy to clarify and explain my ideas. I am also open to any ideas to improve the project if you have any.

## Format

Please use the format defined by the [clang-format file](.clang-format) as much as possible.
You may deviate from this format whenever doing so greatly improves the readability of the code. However, this should be the exception.
In most cases changing the [clang-format file](.clang-format) itself might be the better solution.
